# Contributing

Any open source product is only as good as the community behind it. You can
participate by sharing code, ideas, or simply helping others. No matter what
your skill level is, every contribution counts.

## Games vs Core

These contributions guidelines do not apply in any way to games submitted to the
Boardzilla platform. **You retain full copyright for your game code and
assets.**  This only only applies to code submitted to the actual Boardzilla
core library.

## Copyright

**IMPORTANT:** By supplying code to Boardzilla core in issues and pull requests,
you agree to assign copyright of that code to us, on the condition that we also
release that code under the AGPL license.

We ask for this so that the ownership in the license is clear and unambiguous,
and so that community involvement doesn't stop us from being able to sustain the
project by releasing this code under a permissive licenses in addition to the
open source AGPL license. This copyright assignment won't prevent you from using
the code in any way you see fit.

See our [Contributor License Agreement](CLA.md) for the legal details.
